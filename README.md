# ☕️ Fresh OSX Setup

#### While you can simply run this script, I instead recommend branching this repo and editing the `start_up.sh` file to your personal liking. Everything in there is commented and should be obvious!

---

### Installing

Run the following in your Terminal application.

```
curl -o ~/Desktop/start_up.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/synchronizing/osx-start-package/master/start_up.sh" && chmod +x ~/Desktop/start_up.sh && ~/Desktop/start_up.sh
```

### `start_up.sh`

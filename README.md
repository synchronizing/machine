</p>

This is a machine management tool (as oppose to package management tool) that allows the installation and creation of a custom machine setups, including:

* Installing packages with the OS's package manager (`brew`, `apt-get`, `yum`, etc.)
* Install and/or configure:
  * `tmux`
  * `vim`
  * `zsh` or `bash`
* Store and configure dotfiles (the `.*` files that live in your `~` directory.)

---

## Installing

Run the following to begin the installation (`bash` used for cosmetic reasons; `sh` will also work.):

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/synchronizing/machine/master/install.sh)"
```

Shorter link:

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL self.st/install.sh)"
```
